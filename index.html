                Up to this point, I have successfully developed a total of 6 pages for the mobile application. These pages cover                                         essential functionalities such as Home, Login, Signup, Thread, and Post Your Thread. A key highlight of the app is the Thread feature, serving as the central concept. This feature enables college students to seek technical assistance by posting their doubts, which can then be viewed, solved, and saved by other users for future reference. The platform fosters a collaborative environment where individuals can learn, assist, and grow together within this academic community.
                We are dedicatedly working on enhancing the features of this app. The upcoming updates will cover comprehensive insights into the events organized by our society, including participant feedback on their experiences. Additionally,
                a dedicated page is being developed to showcase detailed profiles of all core members within the society, providing
                a deeper understanding of the driving forces behind our organization’s success.

            <li>Mobile Banking Application Design</li>
            <p>I have personally developed a mobile application with a comprehensive set of features catering to individual users. The application boasts a user-friendly dashboard that not only showcases advertisements but also highlights the user’s profile. It includes a seamless payment system that enables users to conduct all their financial transactions securely. Additionally, users can easily monitor all their transactions through a dedicated section. Furthermore, the application provides a messaging feature that allows users to communicate with family members and other
                individuals in a private and secure manner.
                In my future planning for this app, I aim to introduce a dedicated stocks page that allows users the flexibility to invest their money with ease and confidence. This feature will be designed to not only cater to seasoned investors but also to provide valuable learning opportunities for beginners who want to explore the world of trading. Additionally, users will be able to effortlessly set up the necessary accounts required for trading, streamlining the entire process
                and making it more accessible to all levels of investors.</p>
